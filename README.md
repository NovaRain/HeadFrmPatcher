Head FRM file patcher for [sfall](https://github.com/phobos2077/sfall) 32-bit talking head option (**Use32BitHeadGraphics** in ddraw.ini). Requires .NET Framework 2.0.

This is the standalone version of the same tool in the old [sfall Script Editor](https://github.com/phobos2077/sfall_script_editor). Starting from sfall 4.1.7/3.8.17, you don't have to patch FRM files to load 32-bit images, so the utility is now largely redundant. But it is still included in [the modders pack](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sfall/files/Modders%20pack/) just in case.
